# Forest Fire Simulation

This project is a simple simulation of wildfire spreading in a forest, developed using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. In this simulation, you can click on the forest to start a fire at a specific point and observe how it spreads to nearby trees.

## Features
- Generates a random forest
- Starts a fire at the clicked location
- Spreads fire to adjacent trees based on probability
- Graphically visualizes the forest and fire using Pygame

## How to Run
### 1. Install Dependencies
First, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

### 2. Run the Simulation
Execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python forest_fire.py
```

## How It Works
- The program generates a random forest with trees and empty spaces.
- The user can click anywhere on the forest to ignite the fire.
- The fire spreads to adjacent trees with a certain probability.
- Burned trees turn into ashes and no longer catch fire.
